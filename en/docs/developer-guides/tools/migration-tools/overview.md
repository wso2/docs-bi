# Migration Tools

Migration is the process of transferring integration solutions from one platform to another while preserving functionality and business logic.

In BI, migration tools help accelerate the adoption of WSO2 Integrator: BI by simplifying the migration of existing integrations from other platforms. These tools automate the conversion of integration artifacts, reducing manual effort and minimizing migration risks.

## Migration in BI

BI provides specialized migration tools to help organizations transition from legacy integration platforms to modern, cloud-native architectures. These tools analyze existing integration projects, convert platform-specific artifacts, and generate equivalent BI implementations.

Migration tools in BI support:

**Automated Conversion** – Transform platform-specific integration artifacts into BI-compatible code.

**Coverage Report** – Generate detailed reports on migration progress, including successfully migrated components and areas requiring manual intervention.

Migration tools help organizations modernize their integration infrastructure, reduce technical debt, and leverage the benefits of BI's cloud-native capabilities.
