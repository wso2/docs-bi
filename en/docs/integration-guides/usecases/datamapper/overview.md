# Data Mapper Use Cases

The Data Mapper in WSO2 Integrator: BI enables you to visually transform data between formats such as JSON, XML, and CSV using an intuitive low-code interface.  
This section provides a collection of end-to-end transformation examples that demonstrate practical real-world integrations across various formats.

## What you’ll learn

Each use case in this section helps you understand how to:

- Design input and output types in the Type Editor.
- Use inline or reusable Data Mappers.
- Apply mappings, aggregations, and expressions to manipulate data visually.
- Integrate transformations into automation or other integration flows.

## When to use data mapper

Use the Data Mapper when you need to:

- Transform data between different payload formats (CSV, JSON, XML).
- Build file processing or ETL-style integrations.
- Create API payload transformations between client-facing and backend schemas.
- Minimize manual code and maintain readable, visual mappings.
