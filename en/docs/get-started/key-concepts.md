# Key Concepts

Ballerina Integrator is an all-in-one integration solution that simplifies digital transformation by offering a powerful, configuration-driven approach. It enables developers to visually create integration solutions using an intuitive, low-code graphical interface, making the process faster and more accessible.

## Entrypoint
An entry point refers to the place in the code where the execution of a integration begins. It is the first function that is called when the program starts running. 
In Ballerina Integrator, there are 3 types of entry points:

1. Service: A service is a network-accessible API that is defined by a set of resources. 
2. Automation: Triggers integration with a task. Perfect for scheduled or one-time jobs.
3. Trigger: Start your integration with a Trigger. Best for event-driven actions from external sources.

## Connections
Connections are used to connect to external services. They are used to interact with external services, such as databases, APIs, and messaging systems.
Ballerina Integrator provides a wide range of connectors that can be used to connect to various systems and services.

## Functions
Functions are reusable code blocks that can be called from different parts of the integration. They are used to perform specific tasks or calculations.
Functions can take input parameters and return output values. 

!!! tip "Ballerina Functions"
    Ballerina functions are first-class citizens, meaning they can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned from functions, and assigned to variables.
    This allows for a high degree of flexibility and reusability in your code.
    To learn more, see [Ballerina Functions](https://ballerina.io/learn/by-example/functions/).

## Types
Types are used to define the structure of data in Ballerina Integrator. They are used to define the shape of the data that is passed between different components of the integration.

!!! tip "Ballerina Type System"
    Ballerina has a rich type system that allows you to define complex data structures. 
    It supports various types, including records, arrays, maps, unions, and more. 
    The type system is designed to be flexible and expressive, allowing you to model real-world data structures easily.

## Configurations
Configurations are used to define the settings and parameters of the integration. They are used to configure the behavior of the integration and its components. 
Configurations can be used to set up connections, define global variables, and configure other aspects of the integration in different environments.
Configurations are defined in the `Config.toml` file, which is located in the root directory of the integration project.

!!! tip "Ballerina Configurations"
    1. **Environment Variables**: Ballerina allows you to define environment variables that can be used to store sensitive information, such as API keys and passwords. 
    2. **Configuration Files**: Ballerina supports configuration files that can be used to store configuration settings in a structured format.
    3. **Config.toml**: The `Config.toml` file is used to define the configurations for the integration. It is a standard TOML file that can be edited using any text editor.
    To learn more, see [Ballerina Configurables](https://ballerina.io/learn/by-example/configurable-variables/).

## Source View
The source view is a text-based representation of the integration that can be used to view and edit the code directly. It provides a way to see the underlying code that is generated by the graphical interface.
Switching to the source view allows you to view and edit the code directly, providing more control and flexibility over the integration. 
Clicking on the `</>` button in the top right corner of the design view will switch to the source view.
