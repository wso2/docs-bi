# Create a Project

Project is the foundational unit where you define and manage your integration artifacts. Follow the below steps to create an integration project using the WSO2 Integrator: BI.

1. Launch Visual Studio Code with the WSO2 Integrator: BI extension installed.

    !!! info
        Follow the [Install WSO2 Integrator: BI]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/install-wso2-integrator-bi/) documentation for a complete installation guide.

2. Click on the BI icon on the **Activity Bar** of the VS Code editor.

3. Next, click on **Create New Integration**.

    Then enter a suitable name for the integration project and provide a location for it.

4. It will open the WSO2 Integrator: BI view.

Now, you can start creating your integration by developing artifacts. See the [WSO2 Integrator: BI Artifacts]({{base_path}}/develop/wso2-integrator-bi-artifacts/) to learn about the integration artifacts.

Additionally, you can enhance your experience by incorporating AI-powered assistance with [WSO2 Copilot]({{base_path}}/develop/ai-assisted-development/build-an-http-service-with-wso2-copilot/).
