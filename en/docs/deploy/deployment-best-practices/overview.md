# Best Practices for Production Deployment

This section provides comprehensive security and operational best practices for deploying WSO2 Integrator: BI in production environments. Following these guidelines helps ensure your deployment is secure, resilient, and maintainable.

## Runtime security

Runtime security focuses on securing your BI application and the services it generates during execution, including application-level configurations, patches, secrets management, TLS/SSL protocols, and logging.
