It offers quick feedback loops, easier debugging, and is often used in early stages of integration development.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cloud Deployment:  Designed for scalable, production-grade environments, this option allows BI built integrations to be deployed in private or public cloud infrastructures.

The backup server remains idle until the primary fails, ensuring you always have a failover target.</p> <p>When the primary server fails to send a response, the load balancer immediately redirects the request to backup server. This failover process is automatic and transparent to the client, occurring within milliseconds of detecting the failure. The backup server must be pre-configured with identical application code and dependencies.</p> <p>Nginx tracks failed requests against <code>max_fails</code> threshold and after reaching threshold, server is marked as unavailable for <code>fail_timeout</code> duration. And then keep sending request to one of the backup servers. Once a server is marked as unavailable, Nginx will not attempt to send requests to it until the <code>fail_timeout</code> period expires, ensuring that the backup server handles all incoming traffic consistently. If multiple backup servers are configured, Nginx will select the first available backup server in the order they are defined, maintaining the single-active-server principle of active-passive architecture.</p> <p>After <code>fail_timeout</code> period, Nginx attempts to route traffic back to primary server.

If the primary server successfully handles these test requests without errors, it regains its active status and the backup server automatically transitions back to standby mode.
