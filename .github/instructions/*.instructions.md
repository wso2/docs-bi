# Documentation Style Guidelines

**MOST IMPORTANT:** When creating or editing any documentation, you MUST follow the [Microsoft Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/). All changes must align with these guidelines.

## Overview

All documentation changes, regardless of the issue type, MUST comply with the Microsoft Style Guide.

## Key Rules

The following rules MUST be enforced:

- Use active voice and present tense
- Be concise and use plain language
- Use sentence case for all headings (capitalize only the first word and proper nouns)
- Do NOT use decorative or special symbols (like ¶, →, ») in headings or text
- Use numbered lists for sequential tasks and bulleted lists for non-sequential items
- Format all code elements, UI labels, menu paths, and file names consistently:
  - Enclose UI labels and button names in **bold** (for example, **Create**)
  - Enclose code elements, file paths, and URLs in backticks (`` ` ``)
- Always use correct and consistent product names and terminology
- Use descriptive link text instead of raw URLs (for example, `[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)` instead of `https://portal.azure.com`)
- Avoid colloquial language, jargon, and ambiguous pronouns
- Use inclusive language
- Follow proper punctuation and capitalization rules (end all complete sentences with periods)

## For New Documents - Full Compliance Required

When creating entirely new documentation files:

- EVERY aspect of the document MUST fully comply with Microsoft Style Guide
- This includes document structure, all headings, terminology choices, paragraph structure, examples, code formatting, links, and UI element formatting
- New documents must be reviewed thoroughly to ensure 100% compliance before submission
- No exceptions or partial compliance is acceptable for new documents
- Include a verification statement in the PR that explicitly confirms full Microsoft Style Guide compliance

## Scope Limitation for Existing Documents

When editing existing documents:

- Apply Microsoft Style Guide standards ONLY to the newly created/added content
- Do NOT modify existing content to match style guidelines unless the issue specifically requests formatting/style fixes
- When adding new sections to existing documents, maintain stylistic consistency with the surrounding content while ensuring new content follows Microsoft guidelines
- Focus style compliance efforts only on the portions you're creating or explicitly instructed to modify
